# Skills Demonstrated

This document outlines the technical and operational skills demonstrated by the `secured-gitops-tailscale-homelab` project, with specific evidence and links to implementation details.

---

## 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture & Design

**Skills:**
- Multi-layer architecture design (Infrastructure → Platform → Applications)
- Declarative infrastructure-as-code thinking
- Component coupling and dependency ordering
- Production-grade pattern implementation

**Evidence:**
- **App-of-Apps pattern** — See [`gitops/Chart.yaml`](../gitops/Chart.yaml) and [`gitops/templates/apps/`](../gitops/templates/apps/) for wave-ordered deployments
- **Wave ordering** — Custom Application health probes (ADR-006) ensure `cert-manager` and `external-secrets` are healthy before `vault` starts
- **CSI readiness gates** — Longhorn deployed as wave-0 (ADR-005) to ensure storage is available before stateful workloads
- **Architecture Decision Records** — See [`docs/adrs/`](./adrs/) documenting key choices and tradeoffs
- **Multi-environment support** — `values.yaml` (prod) and `values-dev.yaml` (dev branch) for declarative environment differences

**What Recruiters See:**
You understand how to build systems that scale. This isn't just installing tools — it's composing them intelligently with dependencies, health checks, and safety gates.

## 🔐 Secrets Management & Security

**Skills:**
- HashiCorp Vault HA operations and design
- Kubernetes auth methods
- Secret rotation and lifecycle management
- Least-privilege access controls (RBAC, per-service ClusterSecretStores)
- Zero-trust networking principles
- TLS certificate automation

**Evidence:**
- **Vault HA Setup** — 3-node Raft cluster with TLS, auto-unseal via CronJob. See [`platform/vault/templates/`](../platform/vault/templates/) and [`bootstrap/init-gitops.sh`](../bootstrap/init-gitops.sh)
- **External Secrets Operator** — Per-service ClusterSecretStores with sync-wave ordering. See [`platform/vault/templates/clustersecretstore.yaml`](../platform/vault/templates/clustersecretstore.yaml)
- **Kubernetes Auth** — Vault auth configured per namespace. Bootstrap script handles initial setup at [`bootstrap/init-gitops.sh`](../bootstrap/init-gitops.sh) (lines for auth method config)
- **Auto-Unseal** — CronJob that unseals Vault on node restart (raft recovery). See [`platform/vault/templates/autounseal-cronjob.yaml`](../platform/vault/templates/autounseal-cronjob.yaml)
- **Cert-Manager Integration** — TLS certificates issued and renewed automatically for Vault and services. See [`platform/vault/templates/`](../platform/vault/templates/)
- **Tailscale Zero-Trust** — Mesh VPN for secure ingress without exposing ports. See [`platform/tailscale/templates/`](../platform/tailscale/templates/) and ADR-001

**What Recruiters See:**
You can design and operate production secrets management systems. Vault is enterprise-grade; implementing it from scratch (not just installing) shows deep understanding of security patterns.

## 🚀 GitOps & Declarative Deployment

**Skills:**
- ArgoCD Application lifecycle management
- Helm templating and values-driven deployments
- Git-driven state management
- Sync-wave orchestration for dependency ordering
- Custom Application health checks
- Dry-run validation and preview

**Evidence:**
- **ArgoCD App-of-Apps** — Root application deploying platform apps via sync-waves. See [`gitops/templates/root-prod-app.yaml`](../gitops/templates/root-prod-app.yaml)
- **Helm Charts** — Each platform component (Vault, Monitoring, Tailscale, SeaweedFS) packaged as reusable Helm charts. See [`platform/`](../platform/) directory
- **Values-Driven Config** — Environment-specific values (`values.yaml` for prod, `values-dev.yaml` for dev) drive all deployments. See [`gitops/values.yaml`](../gitops/values.yaml) and [`gitops/values-dev.yaml`](../gitops/values-dev.yaml)
- **Sync-Wave Ordering** — Applications ordered deterministically via `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave` annotations and custom health checks. See [`docs/adrs/006-app-health-and-vault-ordering.md`](./adrs/006-app-health-and-vault-ordering.md)
- **Health Probes** — Custom Lua logic for ArgoCD health checks (wave dependency). See [`platform/vault/templates/`](../platform/vault/templates/) for Vault health checks
- **Bootstrap Script** — Idempotent bootstrap that deploys the root app and configures Vault. See [`bootstrap/init-gitops.sh`](../bootstrap/init-gitops.sh)

**What Recruiters See:**
You understand GitOps as a paradigm, not just a tool. Sync-wave ordering and health probes show operational sophistication.

## 🌐 Zero-Trust Networking & Observability

**Skills:**

- **Network Policies** — Vault server/injector egress policies. See [`platform/vault/templates/networkpolicy.yaml`](../platform/vault/templates/networkpolicy.yaml)
- **Monitoring Stack** — Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), Loki (logs). See [`platform/monitoring/`](../platform/monitoring/)
- **Vault Metrics Export** — Prometheus endpoints for Vault health, sealed state, replication status
- **Log Aggregation** — Loki with S3 backend (SeaweedFS) for centralized logging. See [`platform/monitoring/templates/loki-datasource.yaml`](../platform/monitoring/templates/loki-datasource.yaml)

**What Recruiters See:**
Zero-trust isn't just a buzzword for you — you've implemented it. Metrics collection and observability show maturity in ops thinking.
